From the startKIT level README we see the leds are

This example demonstrates a few things.  It demonstrates how to run
multiple tasks/threads in parallel using par.  It demonstrates raw timer
usage.  The timers freerunning at 100MHz.  There is only one port that
drives all of the leds and so far as I know you can only have one thread
own/use a port, so to let separate threads drive each led.  One thread
actually changes the leds, the other threads use a communication interface
to tell that thread when to do something.  Each of those threads has
a slighly different timeout, it makes for an interesting blink pattern.
