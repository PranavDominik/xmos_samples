This is modified from the XMOS startKIT examples (github) using a
different pattern and much simpler build you dont need all of those
dependencies.

See the startKIT level README file to find schematics and documentation
for this part and board.

From the startKIT level README we see the leds are

This is what I assume they call an XC file rather than just the C language
it has their xmos extensions to the language.

In particular these two lines

port p32 = XS1_PORT_32A;

        p32 <: pattern[ra];

The port name comes from the config file/target specified.  The XMOS
tools lean toward that approach, you specify something on the command
line when compiling which points to a bunch of magic and that magic
contains specific names.  (not really magic just a bunch of config
files)...

delay_milliseconds() is an XMOS api call that does the timing magic
for you.

Once the file figure8.xe is created you can load it into the board
by running

xflash figure8.xe

When finished unplug and re-plug the usb cable and it will load and
run the new program.
