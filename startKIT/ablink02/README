See the next level up README file for information on where to find
docs and schematics for this startKIT board.

Through reading manuals and the code generated by the compiler, I have
figured out somewhat the bare minimum to get a gpio port initialized so
we can blink an led.

Similar to ablink01 from which it is derived.  This example uses a
timer in a mode where the timer read holds the thread, basically causing
the delay we want between led state changes.

These timers are 100MHz based.  If you change

    ldc r3,0x01
    shl r3,r3,24

To this

    ldc r3,0x20
    shl r3,r3,24

The leds change states every 6 seconds or so...

100000000*6 = 0x23C34600

0x20000000 / 100000000 = 5.37

Using a stopwatch again, 0x80<<24 gives about 22 seconds.

0x80000000 / 100000000 = 21.47 seconds.
