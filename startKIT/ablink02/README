See the next level up README file for information on where to find
docs and schematics for this startKIT board.

Through reading manuals and the code generated by the compiler, I have
figured out somewhat the bare minimum to get a gpio port initialized so
we can blink an led.

Similar to ablink01 from which it is derived.  This example uses a
timer in a mode where the timer read holds the thread, basically causing
the delay we want between led state changes.
