See startKIT level README file for information on where to find
docs and schematics for this startKIT board.

This was created using xc code then disassembling then reading the XS1
docs on what each instruction was doing.

This uses threading and a timer and moves data between threads.

Thread 0 uses the timer to wait, sends the port data to thread 1,
thread 1 when it gets data wakes up and writes it to the port.  Repeat
alternating the data being sent.
