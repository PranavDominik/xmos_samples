See the next level up README file for information on where to find
docs and schematics for this startKIT board.

Through reading manuals and the code generated by the compiler, I have
figured out somewhat the bare minimum to get a gpio port initialized so
we can blink an led.

This particular example is not too strange to an experienced assembly
language programmer (for other instruction sets).  You will see more
and more that where you might see loads and stores from/to an address
space to configure/change peripherals, here you will see some specialty
instructions instead.

This example uses a simple count to n loop to time the led blinks, future
examples will show more of the power of this chip by putting the thread
to sleep until the timer wakes it up.
