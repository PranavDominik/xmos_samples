First off, to curb your confusion.  Look at the Programming XC on
XMOS Devices document.  In the bibliography there is a link to
the application binary interface:

http://www.xmos.com/published/abi97

Now that document's bibliography points you at the XS1 Assembly
Language Manual 8.7.

http://www.xmos.com/published/xas87

And now that you have that manual Chapter 8 has a table that connects
the dots between the instruction and its syntax.  For example when you
see the instruction TSETR d,s,r in the XMOS XS1 Architecture manual
the syntax they dont show you is set t[r]:d,s.

Refer to compiling_xc.txt for setting the environment variables/path
to the xmos tools.

I like using the assembler directly, but you dont have to.

One way:

xas myprog.s -o myprog.o
xcc myprog.o config.xn -o myprog.xe -nostartfiles -nostdlib

Another:

xcc myprog.s config.xn -o myprog.xe -nostartfiles -nostdlib

The example directories have a simple .xn file, which is fine for
simulation.  Eventually, when you are running on hardware you will
need a config file that matches your hardware.
