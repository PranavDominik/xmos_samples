Windows may just have the environment variable setup all the time.
In Linux what I do is change to the base directory for the xmos sdk
tools.  Basically be in the directory where the SetEnv script is.

> source SetEnv

Now change to wherever you have the .xc file you want to compile

> xcc myfile.xc config.xn -o myfile.xe

I have provided simple .xn files in each directory, since the examples
use port numbers directly the .xn file is there just to keep xcc happy.
The processor specified in the .xn file does matter so if you are
interested in a single xcore choose a .xn file which specifies a single
xcore chip.
